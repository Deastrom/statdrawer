## Decks
There are 2 visually distinct decks that can be chosen from. Each deck contains cards of the following values: 4*2, 3*3, 4*4, 3*5, 4*6.
The used artwork for cards and the values can be edited in the json files in the decks folder.
An ingame configuration menu is planed for a later date.

## Apply Abilities
You can select which ability a score should be assigned to. Once all 6 scores have been generated and the ability has been asigned you can apply those scores to the character by hitting the Apply button.
